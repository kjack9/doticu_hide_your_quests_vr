# Hide Your Quests
An SKSE plugin for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim SE with an MCM menu that allows you to hide any of your journal's quests!

### Features
- You can show or hide any quest displayed in your journal, including titled, miscellaneous, and finished quests (the greyed out ones.)
- Works with every mod, including mods that come with light plugins.
- Safe to install and safe to uninstall. Safe to clean up its data in the save file using Resaver/Fallrim tools.
- Comes with an option to automatically show or hide new objectives for hidden quests.
- And also an option to automatically show or hide all finished quests, all without changing your previous selections.
- Compatible with the latest version of SSE Engine Fixes, and likely future versions too.
- The code is open source and completely made from scratch. It's also available on GitHub.

### Requirements
- Skyrim VR 1.4.15
- SKSE 2.0.12+
- SkyUI VR v1.0-beta.4+

This mod simply wouldn't exist without you Ellewyn and you were there every step of the way, so thank you!
- The SKSE team and the CommonLibSSE team for showing how it's done. You guys are a huge inspiration for all the work I've put into my [Skylib](https://github.com/r-neal-kelly/doticu-skylib) library, which runs this mod, so thank you!
- To all of you who enjoy and/or endorse my work, you make it worth while creating and sharing these mods. Thank you!
